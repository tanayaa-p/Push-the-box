# Push the Box
#### by: Samuel Peržeľ

## Basic Information
This is a small game, that was made as a school project.
The game is done entirely in python, using the tkinter library.
I have also added a config file to determine the **WIDTH** and **HEIGHT** or variables such as **TILE_SIZE**.

## Game Mechanics
The goal of the game is to get the blue box to the win location.
The main obstacles are walls, which neither you, nor the box can move through.
There is a possibility, that the box will get stuck (for example you get it to a corner).
In this case, you have the ability to restart the level, which will return both the player and the box to their starting position.

## Controls
- WASD --> movement
- R --> reset the level
